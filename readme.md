# Random Content Recommendation Block

This example is working in conjunction with an Alloy Tech Sample Site.

1. Use Visual Studio Extension to install a sample site
2. Download this code and add in top of the sample site
3. Create a category taxonomy structure
4. Create a page in the CMS and give it a category tag (in the category property on the Content tab).
5. Create a block of the type "RandomContentRecommenderBlock" and set the property of "Category Name" to the category added just above
6. Place the block in a content area
7. Make a visitor group for the persona you won't to "personalize" the "content recommendation" for.
8. Utilize the visitor group on the block added above.

The code is not tested in any way other than for functionality. 
THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY!
